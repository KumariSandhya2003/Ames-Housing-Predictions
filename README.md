# Ames-Housing-Predictions
The Housing dataset is taken from the Kaggle website.
The dataset has 1460 observations and 81 variables and it consists of explanatory variables which describes almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames,Iowa.

This is a supervised learning to learn the relationship between the independent variables such as 'BedroomAbvGr,"OverallQual",
"LotArea","GarageType","KitchenQual","GrLivArea","PavedDrive" and the dependent variable which is Sale price of the house.
Altogether, 43 categorical and 38 numerical independent variables.
The objective is to predict the final price of each home and I have used following regression models to predict the sale price:
  
    -Linear Regression
    -Random Forest
    -Gradient Boosting
    -Extra Trees
    -Ridge
    -ElasticNet
